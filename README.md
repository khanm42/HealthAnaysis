# Reflection on Age vs. Weight Proxy Prediction

The initial analysis using linear regression to predict the weight proxy (WTINT2YR) based on age (RIDAGEYR) revealed a high Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of approximately 26221.90. This large error indicates that a simple linear relationship is not effectively capturing the variation in the weight proxy based on age. The scatter plot visually reinforces this, showing a non-linear distribution of data points rather than a clear linear trend. This suggests that age alone is not a strong predictor of this weight proxy, and other factors or a different modeling approach may be necessary to improve the prediction accuracy.

Given the non-linear relationship observed, exploring alternative regression models that can handle non-linearity, such as polynomial regression or tree-based models, could be beneficial. Additionally, incorporating other relevant demographic or health-related features from the dataset, if available and appropriate, could potentially improve the model's ability to predict the weight proxy. The current model serves as a baseline, but further feature engineering and model selection are needed to achieve a more accurate and robust prediction.
